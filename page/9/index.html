				<p>Things change fast, it&#8217;s something I should really come to terms with.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve let myself get caught up in more then one illusion of the future recently, and I need to step back and take things day by day. I have a few quotes that I have liked the moment I heard them, and are pretty good:</p>
<p>&#8220;We suffer from the illusion that we can control things around us&#8221; -Daniel&#8217;s Dad</p>
<p>&#8220;One more road to cross, one more risk to take, gotta live my life like its one more move to make&#8221; -DMX</p>
<p>I have found in the past that I have been most satisfied when I accepted the least control over situations. I think this is highlighted when I felt no dissapointment, anger or frustration when I wrecked my car a year ago. I think it would serve me well to cultivate this acceptance and enjoy things as they are now, while keeping an open mind toward future opportunities and future failures.</p>
<p>There is a chinese proverb that I can paraphrase which attempts to illustrate this acceptance of the world around you through examples:</p>
<p>Old man Wang was a broadminded man. He owned some land and a farm and all the villagers respected him. One day his best horse ran away, so all of the villagers came to console him. He simply said &#8220;There is no reason to be upset, how can I know this is bad news?&#8221;<br />
A week later the horse returned with a mate, this mate was an exceptional stalion of great worth. All of the villagers came to congradulate him, but he just said &#8220;There is no reason to celebrate, how can I know this is good news?&#8221;<br />
Old man Wang had a son who loved to ride horses, and this new stalion was an excelent horse to ride. One day the son went riding and fell off, breaking his leg. All of the villagers came to console him again, and this time he said &#8220;Now you see you cannot judge something as a good or bad event so easily&#8221;<br />
That same month, China went to war with nomadic invaders, a bloody war costing the lives of many fine chinese men. Old man Wang&#8217;s son did not have to serve because of his broken leg, and thus was spared.</p>
<p>While it is not a logical arguement, I feel that it is a nice way to look at things. And by being broadminded about everything, you are much less apt for dissapointment, while being able to seize successful opportunities.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t really thought of a new years resolution, but I think maintaining a more broadminded perspective might be a good one. But hey, it might not, gotta stay broadminded ^_^</p>

				<p>2006.</p>
<p>We will see what it brings. Things don&#8217;t look so good right now, having broken up with Teresa.</p>
<p>I have to look forward to what I am going to accomplish this year. I want it to be the year I actually put things on the internet, the projects I&#8217;ve been dreaming about.</p>
<p>Also I&#8217;m excited about going to Holland in the summer, my family should be there from may 31 to June 17th give or take some days. Also it is possible that I could go to China for an opportunity this summer. Whether or not that happens is too early, but it depends on the contact, and then what I would be sacrificing here as far as work would be.</p>
<p>I want this semester to be very productive, I want to use it as a sort of measure for what I can do. Especially as David and I pick up speed with our programming projects and I start to learn more in my mass media major.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope everyone had a happy new year, mine was hard, but its gotta be for the best.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This semester I enrolled in a class called Introduction to Public Speaking. This is the only requirement I have for my major in Mass Media Studies that has not been completed (aside from the major courses)</p>
<p>The idea of the class is not so bad, and my good friend Daniel and girlfriend Teresa are both in the class. It is because of the class that I even have said girlfriend. All this aside I am pretty bitter with the class. My first speech recieved a grade of 84% and my second speech an 80%. I think both got lower points then they deserved. It is all because I stubbornly refused to do obvious signposting, sacrificing points for my principles.</p>
<p>There are 3 speeches in the class, the first being informative (I did this on Terschelling) the second being persuasive (I did this on the futility of DRM) and the final a special occasion speech. For this speech we were restricted by less rules, and I took advantage.</p>
<p>Jeremy came up with the idea for and helped with the &#8220;plot&#8221; of my speech. Today I presented it to the class, and while I feel my presentation of the first half suffered a couple stumbles, I really nailed the ending.</p>
<p>The speech was so enjoyed by the class that I had requests for the manuscript, and I decided it might be a fun thing to share. I posted it to my website and you can access it either from the side bar to the right, or from this link:</p>
