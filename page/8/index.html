<p>It struck a nerve, so I wrote this frustrating rant in some comments, its transcribed here:</p>
<p>You know why we don&#8217;t do anything? Wanna know why my generation aren&#8217;t activists?</p>
<p>Because we found out that all these causes are bullshit. At the top of each organization is some self serving prick or group of pricks busy fucking somebody else.</p>
<p>I found out the news was just as &#8220;real&#8221; as reality tv before reality tv became popular. I found out that there are no major differences between the two major parties. I found out that the EFF is just as guilty of spreading &#8220;Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt&#8221; as the **AA. I learned that my votes don&#8217;t count anyway, that marching doesn&#8217;t send a powerful message anymore. I learned that the only way to make things right is to buy politicians.</p>
<p>I learned that half of this article is trite political bullshit. I learned in elementary school that the guy dressed up as a king signalling the end of times was crazy, and I have since learned that so is any normal dressed person claiming that the sky is falling. I learned that fear is the easiest way to control the people around you, and to be very wary of any organization using fear to inspire you.</p>
<p>I am the exact demographic that was rioting in the late 60s, but I DONT GIVE A FUCK. I think you&#8217;ll find that I&#8217;m not alone in my demographic.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This past weekend I flew out to Chicago to see my friend Reggie and check out a couple of concerts. Although the trip was a little 4 day vacation I would say it was extremely educational. We didn&#8217;t go to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry or the Art Institute of Chicago, I saw the city streets and heard hiphop.</p>
<p>What I saw was unbelievable. I&#8217;ve been to a couple big cities, mostly abroad, and this was my first real tour of a major American city. It&#8217;s 2006 and the segregation was rediculous. The city is cut like a big pizza (mmm pizza puffs) into different races, and the boundaries are very distinct. Hoping on the redline from the southside I was the only white person in what you could call a station, more like some concrete with fences and plywood. When the train approached 22nd street the black faces blended with some asians from Chinatown. Two or three stops later by 35th street my friends were the only non-white people on the train. The changes were so quick I didn&#8217;t realize what had happened until somebody pointed it out, and by that time we were almost downtown.<br />
Driving around through Chicago shows it even more. One second there are &#8220;Food &#038; Liquor&#8221; stores on every corner, and the next minute every sign and billboard is in spanish, with guys selling cotton candy on every corner. When you get on the northside all the cars become nicer and you start driving by department stores and name brand fashion.<br />
It also made me laugh out of disbelief when we were riding through a black area that was particularly poor when I saw an advertisement that said in big bold letters &#8220;I SEE BLACK PEOPLE.&#8221; It made more sense if you read carefully underneath, in small letters it said &#8220;living, loving, learning&#8221; it was an advertisement for a black tv channel.</p>
<p>What I heard was amazing. I was exposed to classic hiphop and taught what it meant. I watched music get made right in front of me and it was exciting as hell. Hiphop connects to me on a level that other genres just dont touch. Lyricism appeals to my mind while beats get me tapping my feet more naturally than any rock. My only regret is missing out on the 10 to 15 years of classic hiphop I could have been enjoying all this time. Seeing it happen made me want to express myself, but hearing the real stuff, not the 50 cent or lil Jon, made me realize how much more there is to it than I even know. Common, Big L, Wu-Tang where were you when all I had was a DMX and Eminem album? Now I&#8217;m so far behind, but at least I can look forward to getting to know the good shit. Watching Reggie and his friends also amazed me, how rapping is part of them and how they can express themselves so gracefully.</p>
<p>I take comfort in a principle I have recently been able to articulate. Progressive Longevity, constantly making progress towards a distant goal, all the while enjoying the progress and accepting that you havn&#8217;t reached the goal. It applies to work, play and relationships and also with my goals of expressing myself. I can&#8217;t be a rap star, and thats perfectly fine, I know one day I will be able to express myself to my hearts content and as long as I keep making progress through school, websites, video and even music while enjoying that progress I can stay happy.</p>
<p>Chicago was classic and I can&#8217;t wait to go back. Thanks to Reggie, Scott and Fred for making me feel like fam. Peace to <a href="http://classedint.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://classedint.com']);">Classic Edition</a> keep making that Chicago HipHop!</p>

				<p>Your culture is being destroyed, everything from you childhood is irrelevant and the nations children are being systematically destroyed.</p>
<p>Yeah right!</p>
<p>It sounds bad when put like that, but it seems to sound more rational when people say that videogames are leading children into a life of depravity.</p>
<p>I implore you to read this short Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.04/war.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.wired.com']);">article</a> highlighting the mistaken predictions or analyses made in history regarding new forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>I could go on a rant about people preserving culture, but I would probably just end up offending more than provoking thought&#8230; I will just say I believe that basing an action solely on preserving culture is pointless and almost guaranteed to have selfish motivations.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s a Math Major!</p>
<p>As of today I am officially a double major in Mathematics and Mass Media Studies. Say THAT 5 times fast.</p>
<p>I realized yesterday that I have not been feeling fulfilled in what I am studying. I find the subjects in Mass Media Studies to be very interesting and thought provoking, but just not in a certain &#8220;hard science&#8221; way. I realized that the only thing I regret regarding my switch away from Computer Science (besides late night coding sessions + beer in the lab) was losing the study of math.</p>
<p>This is very exciting for me, not only will I get to stay at FSU for at least another year past next spring, but I am pursuing a study I always knew I &#8220;should.&#8221; Staying around is good for me too, work and side projects have been picking up speed, it would be a shame to go just as the momentum has built up. It also allows me more time to stay in college and have fun! I really am not ready to leave in just a year, I&#8217;m not even 21 yet!</p>
