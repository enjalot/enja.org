				<p>As a person with a high capacity for abstract thought, it makes sense that I may sometimes stay on some abstract plane (or train) of thought. When I&#8217;m programming or solving math problems, one could refer to this as being in the zone, but when dealing with people its just plain rude. Over the years I have often taken refuge in my own complex, abstract little world. I imagine elaborate systems of software, the vast possibilities created by combining this and that feature or service and the overarching trends that surround me.Â This has served me well academically and professionally, yet lately as I become more engaged in life around me, I&#8217;ve been finding it to be quite a hinderance.</p>
<p>Grand schemes and big solutions to big problems are great, but they are impossible to carry out on your own. This means dealing with other people, and other people live on Earth. I&#8217;ve found it has become increasingly important to pay more attention to the details that surround me, to not settle for the face value of statements and to read what other people may be feeling or thinking. This is not just for my own advantage, but to be more present in the lives around me. All I want is to build things, but to build just about anything from a relationship with a wonderful woman, to an organization that will revolutionize education means working with other people.</p>
<p>In an attempt to be more mindful of my surroundings I&#8217;m making a renewed effort to blog. Hopefully this will force me to slow down and take stock of whats going on around me by explaining it to you. I&#8217;m kicking it off with this introspective insight, but who knows what&#8217;s next! Explanations of various Scientific Computing projects? The struggles and successes of starting a non-profit providing education for at-risk youth? What I had for lunch?</p>
<p>Add me to your Google Reader and you&#8217;ll find out!</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s taken me over a month to do the write up, but Digital Divide had our first success! The event took place on February 28th at the Palmer Munroe Community Center. We taught 6 kids how to build 5 computers (2 of them were sisters).</p>
<p>We started off with a quick overview of the computer parts, since we had each computer taken apart on each table next to a monitor. Then 5 of our volunteers teamed up with each kid and began helping them put the boxes together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-106" title="sisters and robert" src="http://d3a9pqeyre6pa0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/digital-divide-003_resize-225x300.jpg" alt="digital-divide-003_resize" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Luckily we had med up a couple days before to test out computers and wipe harddrives. This assured us we would have 5 working computers on the day of. Nonetheless we had a few rough spots with miss-aligned jumpers, a bad CDROM drive and a failing harddrive. Luckily we had enough expertise and replacement parts on hand to smooth things over!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-105" title="nathan and girls" src="http://d3a9pqeyre6pa0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/digital-divide-001_resize-300x225.jpg" alt="nathan and girls" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>All five kids are running xubuntu, and loving it. One of the more amazing things I saw was a little girl, who couldn&#8217;t have been older than 10 figure out how to draw a polk-a-dot picture and set it as her desktop. Without any help. She of course had never used linux before. The little guy I was helping immediately set about configuring his screen saver and enjoying the various animations. It&#8217;s amazing what kids can learn just by playing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-107" title="michelle and girl" src="http://d3a9pqeyre6pa0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/digital-divide-004_resize-300x225.jpg" alt="michelle and girl" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>I would say the event was a complete success, the kids had a great time, the volunteers had an amazing experience and we gave away as many computers as we had parts for! We still have some extra parts but require more to build complete machines.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-108" title="ian and boy" src="http://d3a9pqeyre6pa0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/digital-divide-005_resize-225x300.jpg" alt="ian and boy" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone that made this possible, Ms. Aurora Hansen for giving us the space and the kids to work with. The amazing instructors Robert Lam, Nathan Crock, Michelle Lam and Erik Hazzard. Our historian Nikki Velasquez, and burninator Dana Kwiatkowski. I want to thank the volunteers who helped prepare the donations, Raymond Mak and Ana Ng. Last but not least I would like to thank John Marks for coming out and supporting us! Of course good karma to all those who donated, you know who you are!</p>
<p>We will give it another go in the summer, we need to do another round of donations so tell your friends!</p>

				<p>Some life lessons you have to learn from experience, but it seems like no matter how many times you learn them you fail the quiz over and over.</p>
<p>Skateboarding taught me two things. The first and most important was that there will always be people that are better than you, and worse than you. You can always find someone who can&#8217;t do what you can do, and there will always be someone who can do something you can&#8217;t. The worst part is that person who is better than you is probably also younger and you will never catch up. The comforting thing about this observation is that its pointless to dwell on how good other people are and just focus on improving yourself. Skateboarding was always fun, but letting go of how good I was (or wasn&#8217;t) made it even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned from skateboarding was that the only way to make something look easy is to try your hardest. When a good skateboarder does a trick it looks beautiful, smooth and effortless. It&#8217;s as if the board just follows the feet into the air and flips by itself. It hit me the first time I landed a frontside flip off a ledge (kickflip + 180 turn facing forwards). I jumped with all the power in my legs, kicked out my left leg as far is it could extend and sailed through the air rotating smoothly to land back on the board. Putting that concentrated effort into a trick made it look as smooth as it did. Every time I tried to imitate the ease of a trick the board never followed through, or I would land too early. This has resurfaced in my life in other ways recently. I&#8217;m used to coasting through certain types of work, especially math. I could have performed much more gracefuly on the GRE math section had I put in all of my effort, but instead I got plywood to my shin and now my ego is bruised.</p>
<p>This last lesson has nothing to do with skateboarding, but I relearned it recently. It&#8217;s funny how quickly one can forget this simple wisdom. When dealing with women it&#8217;s more important how you make them feel than what you explain to them. Sometimes you don&#8217;t need to go into all the details and reasoning behind some action when all she wants is to feel special. It is completely counterintuitive to the male brain but its amazing how much trouble this simple observation can avoid.Â  It is also an amazing feeling when you get it right ;)</p>

				<p>A seemingly reoccurring problem is organizing information. I often have a lot of information I find useful for one thing or another, but I can&#8217;t always think of the best place to put it so I can save it for later or share it with other people. The internet seems to be providig new tools and better methods almost everyday.</p>
<p>In a fit of reorganization I decided to stick with this blog, http://enja.org for all my blogging needs, and I look to be improving it and posting more regularly.</p>

				<p>This past Monday we took our first concrete steps towards our first workshop. Six people came together to deal with half a living room of computer parts. We took apart the computers, sorted and labeled the parts, set up a test machine and sneezed a lot thanks to all the dust!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We also took the initiative to do some organizational work, starting with a new email account. You can reach our group at digitaldivide.tlh@gmail.com<a href="http://enja.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/table_of_parts.jpg?w=300" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://enja.files.wordpress.com']);"><img class="size-medium wp-image-29 aligncenter" title="table of parts" src="http://enja.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/table_of_parts.jpg?w=300" alt="table_of_parts" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>We are keeping close tabs on our inventory, so we can also give some of our initial numbers in regards to donations:</p>
<ul>
<li>8x Power Supplies and cases</li>
<li>16x Sticks of RAM (average of 256MB)</li>
<li>10x Video cards</li>
<li>16x Ethernet/Modem cards</li>
<li>10x Hard Drives (average of 40GB)</li>
<li>9x Motherboards (7x with processors)</li>
</ul>
<p>With our initial goal of 5 computers for 5 children we have way more than enough parts to build them suitable machines! We will be having another meeting next week to test parts and prepare for our event on the 28th!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://enja.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/boxen.jpg?w=300" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://enja.files.wordpress.com']);"><img class="size-medium wp-image-27 aligncenter" title="boxen" src="http://enja.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/boxen.jpg?w=300" alt="boxen" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>A big thanks to Rob, Nathan, Ana, Michelle and Raymond for coming out and working hard! I know a few people could not make it because of class so we look forward to seeing you guys next week!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>My idea for the Digital Divide project has taken root, and the first steps are laid out for us. Recently I spoke with Aurora Hansen from the Palmer Munroe Community Center and we have set a date for our first workshop and computer giveaway! On February 21st from 1-5pm we will be teaching 5 kids how to build and use their new computers. We are starting with 5 as a sort of test run. It should be a suitably small number to manage, since this will be the first time for most of us teaching kids, and it will be the first time for many of us doing this sort of project.</p>
<p>Sitting in my living room are 8 computers in various states of being. Some have all their parts and will work right now, others have more parts than they should and others still are missing pieces. We will meet up a day or two in advance and test components and select the hardware. We will also want to choose and test a good linux distribution as well as find some good educational and fun content to install. If there is one thing I&#8217;ve learned from all the student activities I&#8217;ve done it&#8217;s that preperation makes for a successful event.</p>
<p>This event will give the cause a solid foundation. How it turns out will determine where we can take this project. The experience we gain will let us know if we want to broaden our focus or scale up our efforts. The more help we have the smoother this event will go, and the smoother it goes the more we can do. I envision that success on February 21st could mean publicity which could mean a large increase in donations. The management of this hardware, as well as proactively seeking out donations and support will become essential to our growth. Already I am running out of space for the donations I have collected from personal connections, so the next step might be to obtain a charitable donation of space.</p>
<p>Like with all ideas, this project is what we make of it. I am really excited about all of the positive feedback I have recieved from friends, family, co-workers and community members. I&#8217;m looking forward to the 21st to turn this idea into reality!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I am looking for something to believe in.</p>
<p>Now this is a broad statement, one with lots of implications, so I will try to narrow it down and define my point. The problem is that I&#8217;m not sure of my point because that is really what I am searching for. I do believe in things, some things I believe in more than others, and I believe in them for different reasons. I believe in evolution, prime numbers, the Incompleteness theorem and harmonics. I also believe in the basic goodness of people, civil rights and education.</p>
<p>What I think I am looking for though, is more along the lines of this gem by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX_(rapper)" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">Earl Simmons</a>, &#8220;I stand for what I believe in, even, if what I believe in, stops me from breathin&#8217;.&#8221; I remember when I first heard this statement, surely not an original sentiment, and how it challenged me. It didn&#8217;t matter how vulgar the context was, or the rest of his messages, this one line made me question myself. I thought, how many things are there that I would die for? That I would actually go against my natural instinct to fight for? I think for a kid in my position it was and is hard to be honest with myself to answer this question. I live a relatively comfortable lifestyle. My parents aren&#8217;t rich, but we certainly have never been poor. I grew up as a white male in America, attending decent public schools and with a caring family at home. I&#8217;ve never flown first class but I&#8217;ve traveled a lot more than a whole lot of people. There really isn&#8217;t much incentive to throw all of that away.</p>
<p>Yet that line bothered me, it had such power, such conviction. I felt like I was missing something because there wasn&#8217;t anything I could speak of with such all encompassing passion. Sure, I would give anything for my family and the people I love, but that mental exercise is pointless. We don&#8217;t live our lives waiting for someone we care about to get into trouble or fall into misfortune before we can find purpose. I felt like I needed to find a source so I could harness this power too.</p>
<p>I was raised by very rational parents, and I have always considered myself a rational person. The more I learned about the world the harder I found it to accept absolutes. This allowed me to put aside this nagging for a belief, because I could spend my energy trying harder to understand the world around me. After all, it would seem rather silly to die for a belief that turned out to be misguided. This fear of being wrong can be both healthy and hindering. I think while developing it is essential to soak in as many viewpoints as possible and broaden ones horizons, but at a certain point a person is moved to act. At that point it helps if there is direction behind those actions, especially in the context of society. Furthermore, if one is driven to make some sort of difference, to promote a change, then I propose that it helps to believe in what one is doing. This allows other people to subscribe to that belief, to contribute their help and further the movement in the direction of that belief.</p>
<p>That is the kind of belief I am looking for. The kind that when mentioned sets the context for a discussion. The kind that energizes people, inspires them to set aside whatever else they were doing to contribute, that makes them eager to dedicate time from their schedule to organize.</p>
<p>I have two candidates at the moment, both beliefs I have held for a long time, instilled by my parents and nurtured over the years. The first is civil rights, and the second is education. I hold a deep belief in human equality, not that we should all be the same, but by being born as human beings we all have equal rights. I have a great disdain for intolerance and a love for exploring other cultures. I do believe that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. For some reason, however, I don&#8217;t see the path. I don&#8217;t know where to start. Well, I have an idea, probably law school, but there is another belief that tugs on my thoughts and stirs up my passion.</p>
<p>That belief is education. I believe based on common wisdom and common sense that education plays an incredibly important role in determining the outcome of ones life. The problem is with the word, and all the implications it brings. I believe in more than just tests and degrees, more than certificates and institutions. Education is something personal, essentially it is completely internal, but access to it can be greatly influenced by external factors. Whether it is learning how to count, or learning how to wire a house for electricity, researching ancient texts, the basics of programming, or how to cook ramen noodles. The end result can only be proved by the person doing the learning. What this means to me is that the idea of education is far too broad a subject to be the kind of belief I am looking for. It is too basic a human function to single out. What I want to believe is that improving education, by giving more children access to more paths, by opening the eyes of young adults to more possibilities and more realities will improve the lives of everybody on this planet. This is still too vague a sentiment to die for. But it may be just beautiful enough to live for.</p>
<p>Maybe I just had to write it down to get a clearer understanding. While dying for an idea is a powerful force, living for one seems more constructive, although perhaps more fragile. Fighting for a positive outcome, constructing change is always more difficult than destructive change. The outcome of construction must be maintained, while destruction is the end result. I think this is why I will never subscribe to the idea that the ends justify the means, because there is no end as time is forever.</p>
<p>The next step then is how to embark on this journey of construction, how to develop new systems and expand on existing ones. How to set processes in motion that will continue to grow with time and provide more openings for more people. How to brand this idea of education, or most likely, what books do I need to read that have already inked this concept. It would be presumptious to think that I am the first one to think like this, so if the movement exists, and the belief is already being followed, sign me up!</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="../../2008/12/18/digital-divide-lets-build-a-bridge/index.html" title="11:23 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">December 18, 2008</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../author/admin/index.html" title="View all posts by enj">enj</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);" target="_blank">Digital Divide</a> describes the gap in skills between those with access to computers and digital technology and those without. I propose a way to build a bridge. The great thing about computers for the last decade is that they are mostly modular and they keep getting cheaper. Computers have gotten so cheap that there are completely usable machines out there that you just can&#8217;t sell because they are over 2 years old.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where we come in. I personally have 2 desktop towers and a laptop that I don&#8217;t use because they are much slower than the computer I do use. They just sit in my closet collecting dust, even though all the parts work, and they would be perfectly suitable for a large amount of common computing tasks such as web browsing, emailing and word processing. All they really need is a sponge bath, a fresh install of a light-weight linux operating system and a little bit of loving and they would be ready for a new home. I know I am not the only one with computers like this, and even more so, many people have older windows computers that they think are broken because of all the spyware and viruses, but will be good as new after a cleansing format and fresh install of linux. For those computers that are really broken, there is a good chance that only one or two essential components are unusable, but the rest of the pieces are in perfect working order. From these we can create frankenstien machines that are stronger, better, faster&#8230; (queue your choice of daft punk or kanye west)</p>
<p>And this is where the real fun comes in. I&#8217;m not just talking about assembling a couple nerds like myself to process and distribute these computers, but starting a workshop for the very kids at the bottom of the digital divide. For those of us who grew up upgrading our video card for the latest video game, and putting in more RAM or installing that internal burner so we could share our pirated music, pulling apart and putting together a computer is no sweat. That means we should have no problem showing a few kids how to do the same. Then we give them an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ubuntu.com']);" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> live cd and watch as they learn.</p>
<p>I know personally several people with the technical skills and the heart to support this effort, in the beginning we need not be too ambitious. As long as we can put a few keyboards infront of the hands of a few kids who wouldn&#8217;t have had the chance, we will have made a difference. I think there are several places this could take place, either at a local community center, or even on Campus. If we find ourselves getting more donations, we should be able to recruit more volunteers from the IT department at FSU. If we can start a sort of organization, perhaps we could raise a few funds from technology companies like Comcast that we could use to shop at the FSU Surplus Auctions for spare parts and extra monitors. We can also take this opportunity to responsibly recycle waste materials, which is not hard to do, but most people don&#8217;t know how.</p>
<p>So if you have an old or broken computer, let me know. If you want to help put together computers and teach some kids at the same time, let me know. If you want to help tweak a custom linux distribution and pack it with fun and educational software, let me know. If there is anything I didn&#8217;t think of, let me know!</p>
<p>Even if we are just throwing a few rocks into the river, lets start building this bridge!</p>

				<p>You forgot to tell me that we were just friends. When I left we talked so honestly, you knew where I was headed and I knew you didn&#8217;t know where you were going. When I came back things seemed the same, like the situation hadn&#8217;t changed and your mind wasn&#8217;t made. I guess you were going to tell me over the cup of coffee we never had. I never followed up because the grapevine told me first.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not angry, I just wanted to write it down because it hurts. I was ready to tell the world when I thought that we would work, so I might as well let em know that it won&#8217;t and no its not a curse. There is no other aspect I wish to balance or argue, I&#8217;m not giving up on you, just closing the book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you found yours, because rest assured I&#8217;m a get mine, it just turned out not to be this time.</p>
