		<description>@Bob, I think it would be better to add a new column where you specify the full name, then access that data when making your text.

so if your new column was called fullname then you could do text(d.fullname) inside the function.</description>

		<description>Hey, this tutorial is pretty neat, but I noticed its a bit different from the one that&#039;s included in the examples on the D3.js site.

https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/examples/bar/bar.html

If you change the labels of the abbreviations of states to the full name (in the CSV file), the full name won&#039;t show up. Any suggests would be super useful - its been frustrating to toy around with getting the labels right.</description>

		<description>@MySchizoBuddy d3 could certainly help you create line charts for scientific data. It is a very flexible and powerful library. It is more about generating a document based on data, so once you get used to thinking in that way it becomes easier to see how powerful it is.</description>
