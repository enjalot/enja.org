		<description>This looks great, and I hope your work with Evan on using this as a C-library works out well.  I can help with Python ctypes wrappers.</description>

		<description>@vilda if only it was so easy ;)
The SPH in Bullet does not have an OpenCL implementation, and we are developing our code so that it is a standalone and open source library. So it will be possible to integrate with Bullet. As our library matures we certainly plan to integrate better with Bullet, GameKit and the BGE</description>

		<description>Guys, this is beautifull, but tell me why you don&#039;t use bullet for the collisions? Bullet has also some sph fluids implementation, and it also is OpenCL, maybe you could just put your code into the bullet library and then use all the goodies of the physics system - you could have floating objects reacting to the fluid and opposite, constraints e.t.c.</description>
