		<description>Same here! I really feel like I&#039;m making progress in maths lately. This is something I like about machine learning (and scientific computing in general). It requires quite a deal of maths but at the same time it&#039;s quite applied and hands-on. Many things which were fuzzy when I was an undergraduate student just make perfect sense now that I see them through the prism of machine learning. Also, I really like to learn the maths I need as I go. It makes more sense and it&#039;s less easy to forget what you&#039;ve learned.</description>
