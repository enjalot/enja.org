		<description>Thanks for this.  I hacked the nbody algo into the kernel.  It works fantastic on my gtx285 with around 10k particles.</description>

		<description>I also had the ImportError: cannot import name get_gl_sharing_context_properties first, so I built pyopencl-2011.2 from source.
Then I had the  &#039;GL_CONTEXT_KHR&#039; exception, which I tried to solve by following the advice above, but after some trial-and-error this worked for me: 
./configure.py --cl-enable-gl

i am on Kubuntu 11.10 (same as Ubuntu), using the most recent nvidia driver.</description>

		<description>Hi,
Thanks for your interesting tutorial.
However, I was wondering how you would do the following thing:
at the moment, you have a single kernel doing all the math, but for some other problems, you can not do that.
Say for example that at a given time you want to sum the speed of all particles (silly example, but you get the idea) and stop on a condition for that value.

As you mention it in your code, we sometime need to keep the vectors in GPU memory, do some other computation and go back to the initial kernel.
How would you do that ?
Waiting for the next example :)

Thanks</description>

		<description>@Aleksandar 

I&#039;ve just spent aaaaaaaall afternoon trying to fix this problem:

&quot;I’ve installed pyopencl 2011.1 and when i run main.py I get this error:
AttributeError: type object &#039;context_properties&#039; has no attribute &#039;GL_CONTEXT_KHR&#039;&quot;

But I finally did it. It indicates that either your device doesn&#039;t support OpenCL/OpenGL interoperability, or that PyOpenCL was compiled without it. To get it to work, I had to download cl_ext.h from the Khronos website and put it in /usr/include/CL/, then alter &quot;siteconf.py&quot; which was created by &quot;configure.py&quot; when building PyOpenCL and set CL_ENABLE_GL to True. 

Since I also spent the day installing various versions of NVidia drivers, it&#039;s possible something else also helped, but I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s what fixed it.</description>

		<description>Hi!

I just bought a new laptop, with an NVIDIA GT555M card, running Windows 7 x64.
I initially had issues running the Python part2 particle demo, with an error similar to some above.
The actual error I got was:
pyopencl.LogicError: Context failed: invalid gl sharegroup reference khr

I realized after a bit of worrying that the problem was in the Optimus device that the newer laptops have, that is the integrated powersaving graphics card, if I understand correctly.
I was however able to fix that by using the NVIDIA control panel and changing the Global settings to always use the NVIDIA GT555M card, instead of the integrated Optimus card. Then I was able to run the demo without the error message.</description>

		<description>I just installed ubuntu 11.04 and used synaptic package manager to install pyopencl.
When I try to run the example programs I get:

Xlib:  extension &quot;GLX&quot; missing on display &quot;:0.0&quot;.
freeglut (main.py): OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display &#039;:0.0&#039;

Please advise how to fix this.</description>
