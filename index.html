                        the goal for Tributary is to provide an
                        infrastructure which makes coding visual artifacts more interactive
                        and easier to share.

                        At Visual.ly I designed and prototyped web application

                        consuming API's on the backend with node.js.

                        I started learning Chinese for a 2005 Study Abroad trip to Tianjin, China.<br>
                        I continued my studies and was asked to serve as Resident Assistant 
                        for the Study Abroad program in Tianjin for the summer of 2007<br>

                    <p>
                        After returning from China for the second time, I founded the
                        Chinese Language and Culture Association, a student organization to
                        bring together American, Chinese and Chinese American students.
                    <p>
                        Through my involvement in student activities I became Director
                        of Asian American Student Union in 2008. As director I oversaw
                        the coordination of cultural events and managed a sizable
                        budget.

                        In the summer of 2008 I attended the Beijing Olympics and
                        surfed the couches of my Chinese friends in Tianjin and
                        Beijing.

                        and learned Objective-C and PyObjC in the process.

                        I worked at the Florida Resources and Environmental Analysis
                        Center, or FREAC. Throughout those years I wrote many utility
