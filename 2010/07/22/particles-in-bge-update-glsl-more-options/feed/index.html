		<description>@Whimsy Collective that should be possible relatively soon. I need to improve the rendering capabilities and my knowledge of GLSL for smoke, and I haven&#039;t tried it yet but I&#039;m going to look into SPH for fluids.</description>

		<description>@Enj Have you tried Smoke and Fluids in BGE?  I know it is slow having to build external cache.</description>

Thanks! We have found that the compositor node is pretty inefficient and could certainly benefit from an OpenCL speedup. Unfortunately I need to spend all my time on the BGE particles for now. As my code matures I hope it can serve as a launching point for integrating OpenCL in Blender. I think one of the hardest parts is getting the libraries loaded and setting up the devices cross-platform. After that there would be a lot of low-hanging fruit :)

@Martin
I wrote you an email :)
Just to be clear for others reading though, right now rendering isn&#039;t really possible since this is all in the game engine. I take screencasts of playing in the game engine, but I still desperately need some good looking material to demonstrate!

I have a twitter account, its enjalot, but I&#039;ve let it fall off... perhaps I will dust it off this weekend</description>

		<description>@enj 

Sweet, I&#039; pop in and out on #blender and #blendercoders (like to hang around) . Sure I would love to help you out w/ artwork and stuf for your demo&#039;s. I&#039;m sending an e-mail to you so you get my email and we can talk there, or if you see me on IRC it&#039;s &quot;aermartin&quot;

do you have a twitter acc?

if you set up the initial scene and explains what you need, I can do the rest in blender. model/animate, composite as best as I can and optimize for best results/fastest render. And then I can send it back to you for render w/ your OpenCL patch/SRC code.

Cheers, keep up the good work, and I hope it goes well with the thesis/studies.</description>

		<description>sadly for me, I&#039;m not too interest in BGE but more in internal, simulation and for sure Compositor node. 
But this is incredible, it is good that someone finally is getting into openCL w/ Blender. hopefully it will be used to speed up some tools, Compositor node really need some speed up improvement</description>

		<description>@Martin thanks for the support! It&#039;s certainly a goal that my continued improvement in OpenCL will rub off on other devs :) 
I&#039;ll certainly be working on this for the next year since it is the basis of my Master&#039;s thesis. I don&#039;t have a paypal button up, maybe I will at some point... but if you&#039;re feeling generous even a little bit of your graphic design talent would be more valuable!

I&#039;m on gtalk and IRC all day, my email is on my about page and I&#039;m enjalot in the blender IRC channels.</description>
