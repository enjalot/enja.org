		<description>You mention storing native formats in files.  You didn&#039;t mention byte ordering.  For example, if you write a four-byte int out to a file on an x86 box, then transfer that file over to a PowerPC box, and read the int into a program, you&#039;re going to be hosed unless you take special precautions.  That&#039;s because x86 stores integers as &quot;little endian&quot; that is, the four bytes that make up the integer are ordered so that the least significant byte is first, and the most significant last, or &quot;little end first.&quot;  The PowerPC thinks that 4 byte integers are stored in the reverse order, with the first byte being the most significant, and the last byte being the least significant, or &quot;big end first&quot;, or, &quot;big endian&quot;.  The same problem occurs with networking. The solution to this is to define the file format such that it specifies a byte order.  Typically, big-endian (also known as &quot;network byte order&quot;) is used for external data formats.  There are functions in the C library like ntohl and htonl -- &quot;net to host long&quot; and &quot;host to net long&quot; for converting between &quot;host&quot; byte order (be that big or little endian or some weird mixture like DEC machines could do) and &quot;network&quot; byte order -- typically big endian.</description>
