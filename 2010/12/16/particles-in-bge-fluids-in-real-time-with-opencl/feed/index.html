		<description>This is soo awesome! Could we get an update on how it&#039;s going and maybe an approximate time frame of when we could see this? That would be great. :)</description>

		<description>Wow, that s some impressive work. What&#039;s the possibility of you later attempting to integrate your library with a preexisting game engine, such as cube 2? Dynamic fluid effects would be an amazing addition to modern games. I understand that it Probably has it&#039;s own interfaces and dependencies, and would be a difficult project, but you have already created quite an effect.</description>

		<description>Particles.
Would you be able to look into Grass / Hair particles?
The GE really lacks Grass, ask anyone!
hair, not so much, but i presume would work in a relatively similar way.
Because most of the properties in the GE are defined in the Logic or the Physics tab, i think add as an actuator!
that way, you can enable/disable it in the GE via python.
From there make the settings on the actuator accessible via python, e.g
import bge
controller = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
particle = controller.actuators[&quot;particle&quot;]
particle.length = 3.0
particle.emit = 50
etc....</description>

		<description>Nice work!

Any chance we can get hold of the branch and/or patches?</description>
