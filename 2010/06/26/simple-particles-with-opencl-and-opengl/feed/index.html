		<description>Turns out that it was glFinish() taking up the time that made us think there was memory copying. Changing the timings we get much more expected results: rendering takes up the most time, followed by kernel execution (both are dependent on size) while acquiring and releasing OpenGL objects is cheap and does not appear to depend on the size of the arrays!</description>

		<description>@Brian: that makes sense, thanks!

@Andrew: thank you for pointing that out! I have the 9400M which a quick googling reveals does use shared memory (all 256mb =\ ). It&#039;s kind of a let down, but it&#039;s a reality check!
OpenCL reports that the card supports OpenGL interop, and the code still works but I guess the memory is being transfered by the underlying system. When I get good timings I should be able to confirm this.</description>

		<description>You mentioned you didn&#039;t get any performance increase on your MBP. One cause of this may be that your video card is using shared memory. It is not uncommon for laptop video cards to use part of main memory as video memory. Typically they will have about half dedicated and half shared. You may want to check your MBP&#039;s specifications to find out the details and whether or not it uses shared memory.</description>

		<description>@enj: Yeah, you want to avoid conditionals for GPU targets since the compilers usually have all of the workgroups execute the computation for both branches and only end up using the conditional expression to decide which results get written back to memory.</description>

		<description>@Nathan: It&#039;s a safe bet that OpenCL will make it to phones eventually!

@Brian: Thanks for the tip! I definitely want to try some more fun stuff with the system, I know there is a more clever way to deal with the lifetime but I was too busy getting things to work properly. From my preliminary understanding one wants to avoid conditionals if possible right?</description>

		<description>if(life[i] &lt;= 0.)

You might be able to generalize this code (maybe shuffling some code to/from the host) to omit this conditional, and it would probably perform better.</description>
