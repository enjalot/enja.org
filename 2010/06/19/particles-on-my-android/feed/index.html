		<description>Yes C surely C/C++ on Android 3D Apps are possibe on Android and even its possible with Bullet Physics Engine, Check Website, in a day or two you have a video also on Bullet Integration</description>

		<description>@Seto
I&#039;m not running OpenCL on the Android... The OpenCL code runs on computers that have OpenCL support. 
Incidentally I&#039;ve improved my C++ code in the Android section and used Crystax&#039;s NDK tool chain to use the STL. Now my android library and desktop library are almost identical! With a little more work I should be able to have the CPU based code completely identical, I&#039;ll write all this up in a little while when its ready.</description>

		<description>Are you kidding me? How can you run OpenCL on Android without OpenCL support?</description>

		<description>You can actually write in C or C++, and when you use the NDK you get access to OpenGL ES 2.0 (on supported devices).
It&#039;s pretty straight forward, you end up writing the interesting code in C/C++ then calling it from Java functions.</description>

		<description>C on Android? I have an HTC Hero and every developer I&#039;ve asked has assured me that you can only develop with Java on Android. If it&#039;s possible to develop with C, it would actually be fun to write applications.</description>
