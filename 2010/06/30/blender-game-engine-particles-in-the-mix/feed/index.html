		<description>Hello,

I&#039;m relatively new to blender, but I&#039;m very impressed with what you&#039;re doing here. Personally, I think the physics simulations (smoke, fluids, cloth, etc.) would benefit immensely from OpenCL acceleration. That combined with a GPU accelerated render engine like others are working on with the LuxRays project would revolutionize the speed of my work flow. Anyway, just wanted to say keep up the good work.

		<description>That was really amazing.
Keep going. Thats because of pepole like you (and ofcourse Ton and all who contribute to Blender community) belnder gonna be the most powerful animation package.
Real Hat ups to you freind</description>

		<description>@rhys: the official goal is to be able to do scientific visualizations in an interactive environment. Improved performance for other aspects (my project will hopefully make it easier to integrate opencl Bullet for example) and particle effects like fire/smoke are benefits that should come along the way.

@gustav: thanks for the heads up! I&#039;ll be sure to check out Lukas&#039; work and get in contact with him so that energy isn&#039;t wasted!</description>

		<description>Looks very interesting! Lukas Tönne just started working on a redesign of blender’s particle system. I don&#039;t know how much your work relate to each other but if the do it might be interesting to communicate and align your work. It would be sad to see two promising projects interfere with each other…

		<description>Sicko!
What is your end goal?
-For high res particle simulations in an interactive environment/game engine?
-Game engine particle system for ingame fx (explosions,fire etc)?</description>

		<description>Great work so far.  The modifier idea is intriguing.  The OpenCl is AWESOME!!! Looks solid in its early state.

You mentioned requests, so I&#039;ll throw some out:

•I would enjoy the ability to have the individual particles interact with (other objects in)the bullet physics engine in blender. 

•The ability to animate particles with other modifiers that are AFTER the particle modifier in the modifier hierarchy, like an animated array modifier &amp; simple deform, would be cool too, but not sure if its feasible

•The ability to &quot;crossfade&quot; between 2(or more) particle systems within the modifier. Something abstract like this could be VERY useful</description>

		<description>Looks cool - when moving the emitter, the previous particles should stay in place ( if you fire a gun and rotate the gun, the bullet won&#039;t rotate with the gun ).

You should also contact Erwin at http://code.google.com/p/gamekit/  or bulletphysics.com - if you use the right license, it can be used as part of GameKit ( an external open source Blender GE player, but with a license the same as Bullet - ie it can be used in Blender, but also commercially ).</description>

		<description>Consider that your advisor&#039;s wishes have maximum priority. 

I am not sure that a modifier is the way to go. You will want new particles to be created as time goes on and old ones die. Read some articles on particle generators.</description>
